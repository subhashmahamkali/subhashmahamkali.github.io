# Media Library Guide

This folder stores all visual assets used by the website.

## Directory Map

- `assets/media/photos/under_grad/` -> undergraduate fieldwork, classroom, and project photos
- `assets/media/photos/masters/` -> master's lab, thesis, and campus milestones
- `assets/media/photos/CTRI/` -> CTRI fieldwork visuals
- `assets/media/videos/` -> web-ready videos (`.mp4` recommended)

## Recommended Formats

- Photos: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`
- Videos: `.mp4` (preferred), `.mov` (store original if needed)

## Practical Rules

- Prefer descriptive filenames using lowercase with underscores.
- Keep web-facing images in `.jpg`/`.webp` for maximum browser support.
- Keep only finalized media in page references to avoid broken links.

## Where These Files Are Used

- `pages/journey.md` -> photo-based timeline and milestones
- `pages/videos.md` -> embedded video player and direct video links
