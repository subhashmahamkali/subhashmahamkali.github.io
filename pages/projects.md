## Featured Work

### Sorghum Evolutionary Genomics
Built analysis workflows to identify adaptation signals and characterize diversity patterns in sorghum populations.

- Domain: crop evolution and quantitative traits
- Methods: population genetics, comparative analyses, reproducible scripting
- Value: supports better trait targeting for breeding and biological interpretation

### Computational Trait Analysis
Developed data-centric workflows for trait analysis across environments and genotypes.

- Tools: R, Python, HPC
- Focus: clean data handling, reproducibility, and transparent statistical logic
- Outcome: faster iteration from raw data to interpretable results

### MXene Nanomaterials (Interdisciplinary)
Worked on interdisciplinary research bridging experimental and computational interpretation.

- Contribution: data processing and scientific synthesis
- Value: demonstrated cross-domain adaptability and collaboration
