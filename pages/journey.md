<div class="journey-intro">
  <p>My undergraduate years in agriculture were highly practical: field planning, farmer outreach, seed and soil work, and team-based farm projects. Those experiences built the foundation for how I approach data-driven biology today.</p>
</div>

## Timeline

- **Undergrad (Agriculture):** built strong foundations in crop science, hands-on field methods, and applied problem solving.
- **Early computational training:** adopted R and Python for biological datasets and statistical workflows.
- **Internships and research collaborations:** strengthened practical genomics analysis and scientific communication.
- **PhD at UNL:** integrated fieldwork, genomics, and high-performance computing pipelines.
- **Current direction:** computational biology and data-intensive roles where research rigor translates into practical outcomes.
